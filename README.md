# pybricks-stub-file
For use with the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Micropython extension in Visual Studio Code. This repository contains a single file called "pybricks" that acts as a stub file of the real pybricks (located on micropython SD card image when flased for inserting into EV3.) so you can use intellisense with pybricks, even when it's not currently in your program directory when coding.

--Instructions--
* To use, simply place the "pybricks" folder in the same directory as your main script.

* You don't need to remove the stub file from the directory when your ready to code. You can leave it in there and it will function the same


Note: I'm sure there are more professional/efficient ways to accomplish the same thing without needing a folder dedicated to acting as a stub in your program, but this is a very simple & straightfoward way of accomplishing the same thing. No pip installs or anything like that required.


-- Updates--
