# pybricks-stub-file
For use with the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Micropython extension in Visual Studio Code. This repository contains a single file called "pybricks" that acts as a stub file of the real pybricks (located on micropython SD card image) so you can use intellisense with pybricks, even when it's not currently your program directory when coding.
